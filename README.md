Overview

This notebook contains the end-to-end implementation of a machine learning–based fraud detection system, developed as part of an AI/ML capstone project. It covers data exploration, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, interpretability, and external validation.
The primary objective is to identify behavioral and contextual signals that effectively distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones in highly imbalanced datasets.
